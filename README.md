# weewx-websocket-service
A weewx service for pushing LOOP data to a websocket server

# Installation
You will need to install the required python packages yourself if they are not already on your system. I did it with pip. They are:
- websocket (`>pip install websocket-client`)
- threading
- json
- os
- dotenv
